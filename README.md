# beau-assist.

With the plethora of skincare and makeup products that are being released constantly, we all know it can be intimidating to navigate a crowded website and choose products that would work for your skin. We created Beau Assist with an intuitive and simple design, to help users create a tailored beauty routine and most importantly build confidence. 

## User Stories

We were inspired by the people who surround us. Our team spends time with elderly family and friends on a daily basis, so we wanted to create a product that would not only benefit them, but anyone else who uses it.
